# Java Project - Tracking, Code & Screencasts

We have almost 15 days in class to explore and create a project using Java.

Choose any project to develop either using one of the tutorials provided on Canvas or any other tutorial you find online.

Add in your own notes/comments to explain what each portion of the code is doing.

You will need to keep a journal of your progress for each day you work you will not the progress you made. *AP CSA Final Project Progress Tracking

You can work with a partner but I expect collaboration to lead to more efficiency and a better project.

Submit your code (link to Repl.it or a zipped file). Make sure you include the .java and any other libraries or resources including images or other files.

Record two screencasts:
  One recording of you running/playing their Java game or project. You need to make sure that all aspects of your game are demonstrated in your recording.
  Another recording explaining your code using correct terminology that was used throughout the course. Your explanation must thoroughly demonstrate your understanding of your code and the Java concepts that were explored this semester.
    You can turn in your code with comments and both recordings to this assignment but uploading the three files. Or, you can place the files in a Google Drive folder, share the folder appropriately ("Anyone with the link can view"), and turn in the share link.
